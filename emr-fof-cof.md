# EMR for Frequency of Failure (FoF) and the Muhlbauer Consequence Method

## Overview
The Muhlbauer EMR method provides a modern, engineering‑based approach to the **probability side** of Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA). It replaces traditional, data‑heavy statistical models with a transparent, deterministic structure that evaluates the **Frequency of Failure (FoF)** using engineering estimates rather than historical failure rates alone.

On the **consequence side**, the Muhlbauer method simplifies the complex world of Consequence of Failure (CoF) into four multiplicative components:

**spill/release × spread × product hazard × receptor count**

Each component has clear physical meaning and measurable units.

Together, this FoF and CoF approach not only produces fully QRA risk estimates but also sets the stage for fully probibilistic risk assessments (PRA) when desired.

# 1. EMR as the Modern Approach to Frequency of Failure (FoF)


## 1.1 EMR Replaces Traditional Probability Models
Traditional QRA probability models often depend on:

- Sparse or unreliable historical failure data  
- Statistical assumptions that do not generalize  
- Industry‑specific datasets  
- Complex probabilistic modeling  

The EMR method provides a **new approach** to the probability side of QRA by focusing on engineering reality rather than statistical artifacts.

## 1.2 EMR’s Structure for FoF
EMR evaluates FoF through three engineering‑driven components:

1. **Exposure** — the degree to which the asset is subjected to hazards  
2. **Mitigation** — measures that reduce the likelihood of the failure mechanism acting on the structure  
3. **Resistance** — the inherent ability of the asset to withstand hazards  

These components combine to produce a **Frequency of Failure estimate** that is:

- Deterministic  
- Transparent  
- Repeatable  
- Traceable to physical conditions  

This makes EMR a superior method for modern QRA probability modeling.

# 2. Muhlbauer’s Simplified Consequence of Failure (CoF) Method

## 2.1 The Four‑Factor CoF Structure
The Muhlbauer CoF method expresses consequence as:



\[
\text{CoF} = \text{Spill/Release} \times \text{Spread} \times \text{Product Hazard} \times \text{Receptor Count}
\]



### **Units**
- **Spill/Release** → ft³  volume released
- **Spread** → ft²/ft³  how far and wide the release spreads
- **Product Hazard** → \$ per unit of receptor damage considering toxicity, thermal damages, etc
- **Receptor Count** → units/ft²  count or density of anything that could receive harm from the release

### **Resulting CoF Units**


\[
\text{ft}^3 \times \frac{\text{ft}^2}{\text{ft}^3} \times \frac{\$}{\text{unit}} \times \frac{\text{units}}{\text{ft}^2}
= \$/\text{event}
\]



This structure captures the essential elements of consequence in a physically meaningful, mathematically consistent way.  It recognized monetization of risk as the most complete, robust, and transparent measure of consequence potential and overall risk.

## 2.2 Why This Works
The four‑factor structure:

- Is intuitive and easy to explain  
- Avoids black‑box consequence models  
- Scales across asset classes  
- Aligns with regulatory expectations for transparency  
- Allows consistent comparison across segments or assets
- Directly leads to risk management opportunities

It is one of the reasons the Muhlbauer method is widely adopted.  Multiplying these factors together shows that CoF in significantly changed by changes in ANY ONE of the factors.

# 3. Adapting CoF for Non‑Hazard‑Zone Assets

## 3.1 The Need for Modification
The original Muhlbauer CoF method assumes a **hazard zone**, such as:

- Pipeline rupture impact radius  
- Thermal radiation zone  
- Blast overpressure zone  

For assets that do **not** have a hazard footprint, the CoF model must be adapted.

## 3.2 How to Modify the CoF Structure
For non‑hazard‑zone assets (e.g., tanks, substations, bridges, facilities), the four factors remain valid, but the **spill/release and spread terms** must be redefined.

Examples:

- **Facilities** → use building footprint or process area  
- **Bridges** → use span area or collapse footprint  
- **Substations** → use equipment layout and fire spread potential  
- **Chemical storage** → use spill area or plume modeling  
- **Rail corridors** → use linear impact zones rather than circular ones  

The remaining two factors — product hazard and receptor count — remain unchanged.

# 4. Summary

- EMR provides a **new, engineering‑based method** for the **Frequency of Failure (FoF)** portion of QRA.  
- It replaces traditional statistical probability models with a deterministic Exposure–Mitigation–Resistance structure.  
- Muhlbauer’s CoF method simplifies consequence into four multiplicative factors with clear physical units.  
- For non‑hazard‑zone assets, only the **spill/release and spread definitions** need modification; the rest of the CoF structure remains valid.  

This combined approach makes the Muhlbauer EMR method a powerful, generalizable framework for risk assessment across all infrastructure types.
